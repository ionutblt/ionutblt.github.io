We often have people tell us, "I found my great grandpa's old railroad pocket watch, and it ran great for a while but then I heard something snap and now it won't run anymore." Now just think about that for a minute. Would you take grandpa's old model-A Ford out of the barn where it had been sitting idle for the past 50 years, and start it up and try to drive off down the road without making sure that the engine was in good condition and that everything was properly lubricated? Of course not! But many people do essentially the same thing with a delicate piece of machinery like a 100 year old watch without so much as a second thought. If your watch hasn't been serviced in years, or maybe even decades, then it needs to be properly serviced before being used. Running a watch "dry and dirty" is a sure way to cause damage that could significantly increase the expense of repair. </span>

Unfortunately, we can't just phone the factory and have them send us the new parts we need. (you might be surprised how many times I've heard a customer suggest that). As such, there's a fairly wide range in how long a repair can take depending on whether or not parts are required and/or available. Repairs that are in for simple services like a crystal replacement can often be completed in only a few days, while difficult repairs requiring an extensive search for parts can take much longer. Each watch is serviced in the order received, and we give each watch the attention it deserves when its turn for service comes. We are always willing to answer questions about the status of your repair, and your patience will be rewarded with a watch that's been repaired carefully and correctly!</span>

Now before I get a lot of angry emails from jewelry store owners, let me state that I'm sure that there are jewelry stores who still employ a skilled watchmaker... but they are getting to be few and far between! There was a time when every jewelry store had a skilled watchmaker on staff, but that is no longer the case. Many jewelers still claim that they repair watches, but most actually send all mechanical (wind-up) watches out to someone else, or they have someone on staff who's pretty good at changing batteries, but doesn't have a clue how to repair a mechanical watch. So chances are, you'll either end up paying a lot more for your repair by having a "middle man" in the transaction, or you'll get bad results. Of course, if you know that your jeweler has a top-notch watchmaker on staff, then by all means use them... but be sure to ask a few questions before leaving your valuable watch with just any random jewelry store.</span>

If you carry (or wear) your watch daily, it is going to need service sooner than if you have it on display under a glass dome, or tucked away in a drawer. We recommend servicing a regularly-used watch every 2-3 years, and for a watch that is on display or used only occasionally every 5 years. Even the finest lubricants (which we use) will dry out after a number of years, so 5 years is about the longest you can go and still hope to have some lubrication on the watch.</span>

First your vintage watch is completely disassembled. Then the watch is thoroughly cleaned in a multi-step ultrasonic cleaning process. Cleanliness is critically important to the proper operation of your watch. Once clean, we can begin the reassembly of your watch. Each part is carefully inspected, adjusted, and lubricated as the watch is reassembled. We use as many as 5 different types of watch lubricants while reassembling your watch, and use only the finest synthetic horological lubricants. Once the movement is assembled, we thoroughly clean and polish the watch case. Final assembly consists of re-attaching the dial and hands, and re-casing the watch . Each watch is then timed on an electronic watch timing-machine for best-possible timekeeping. Finally, we give each watch at least a 30-hour "run in" period to ensure proper operation and good timekeeping. We know that there are cheaper and faster ways to clean a watch (like the "dip and swish" cleanings offered by some shops), but we don't know any better way to ensure that the job has been done properly.</span>

When this happens, watchmakers say the mainspring is "set," and it will no longer provide enough power to properly run the watch.

                                <div><span>Professional dial refinishing can produce a result that looks "nearly new." By "nearly new" we mean that the dial will probably not look as perfect as a factory original, but it will look darn good! An expert could likely tell that it was refinished, but most non-experts could not. It is a great option for worn, faded, or stained metal dials where a significant improvement in cosmetic appearance is desired. Dial refinishing is only possible on metal dials; enamel dials cannot be refinished.
                                If your goal is absolute originality, then you should not refinish your dial. Some collectors would consider a refinished dial as "inferior" to an original dial, and a refinished dial may adversely impact the value of a collectible watch. The dial refinisher will match the details of the dial as closely as possible, and they have dial "prints" for tens of thousands of dials. But they don't have every variant of every dial for every watch... so minor changes in font size or style, dial signature, color, and other design details are always a possibility. If you want your dial to be precisely "the way it was before" then you would be better to keep it as is and not refinish it.
